The goal of this set of classes is to take the protein and gene expression levels
and the physical interaction network and generate data for the Bayes net that I want to
learn using PNL. We need the following classes:

Interaction
InteractionManager
Gene
Protein
Framework

Unfortunately, just by sampling genes and protein ids will not work. The result is a disconnected 
network where the protein protein interactions do not play any role in the rest of the network.
First, we need to pick a gene node and follow all its paths via pp and pd interactions.
Then at some point we need to go back and refine our model as to how pp interactions play
a role in transcription.

Refined design
---------------
New classes BioNode and BioNetwork. Gene and Protein nodes will derive from BioNode.
BioNetwork is made up of a set of BioNodes. It will take the protein-protein and protein-dna
interactions and create the physical network, with appropriate in and out neighbours.
The BioNodes have a type field associated so that they may find out, whether their neighbours 
are proteins or genes and accordingly add a protein-protein interaction edge or a protein-dna
interaction edge.
BioNetwork
- create: This will create the physical network using the protein protein and protein-dna interaction managers
- getReachability: This will for each BioNode do the reachability analysis


BioNode
- findReachableNodes: This will find the set of reachable nodes using BFS
- all other functions that were previously associated with the Gene and Protein nodes.
